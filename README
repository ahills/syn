Usage: syn < infile > outfile

Executes shells commands inside {{ and }} delimiters (configurable: set
delim_open and delim_close in config.h) and substitutes their output.
Currently, expressions to be evaluated are limited to BUFSIZ characters.

To build:
$ make test
To install to $(PREFIX) (in config.mk):
$ make install

To build on systems, like Mac OS X, which forbid static compilation, clear
LDFLAGS in config.mk or build with the command:
$ make LDFLAGS=

Unavoidably, templates can be evaluated within one another by making calls to
the program within the delimiters. Exercise caution here; no protection from
recursive execution until you hit your process limit is provided.

Please report bugs to Andrew Hills <ahills@ednos.net>.
